              Competitive Rivalry: High
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Vietnamese medical device market faces intense rivalry, with ~90%
              of devices historically imported. Foreign entrants compete on quality,
              innovation, and cost. VHD must improve efficiency and product quality
              to stand out. AI-driven predictive maintenance and computer-vision QC
              offer cost and quality advantages.

            <p>
              Hospitals and healthcare providers can choose international brands
              and demand top quality. VHD can reduce buyer leverage by offering
              blockchain-based traceability and AI-optimized reliability to foster
              loyalty and differentiate on transparency and trust.

              Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Moderate
            </h2>
            <p>
              Specialized components are often imported, giving suppliers some
              leverage. Blockchain traceability holds suppliers accountable for
              quality. Predictive maintenance reduces urgent spare-part dependency
              and may enable diversification of suppliers.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Although regulatory approvals and capital costs act as barriers, AI
              solutions are increasingly accessible to startups. VHD’s early
              adoption of AI and blockchain raises entry barriers by building
              digital capabilities and proprietary data advantages.

            <p>
              Substitutes may include alternative treatments or competing devices.
              If VHD’s devices lack quality or trust, buyers may switch brands.
              Blockchain-enabled authenticity and computer vision QC reduce
              substitution risk by making VHD’s devices the safer, more reliable
              choice.
